This is the code repository for ARP Spoofing and Man In The Middle Attacks: Execution and Detection [Video](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/arp-spoofing-and-man-middle-attacks-execution-and-detection-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
In this course you will start as a beginner with no previous knowledge about penetration testing. The course is structured in a way that will take you through the basics of networking and how clients communicate with each other, then we will start talking about how we can exploit this method of communication to carry out a number of powerful attacks. This course focuses on the practical side of wireless penetration testing without neglecting the theory behind each attack - all the attacks explained in this course are launched against real devices. All the attacks in this course are practical attacks that work against any device connected to your network, so it does not matter what kind of device you are targeting. Each attack is explained in a simple way first so that you understand how it actually works - first you will learn the theory behind each attack and then you will learn how to carry out the attack using Kali Linux.

<LI>This course includes 21 detailed videos about practical attacks against Wi-Fi networks. </LI>
<LI>Learn network basics and how devices interact with each other; map the current network and gather info about connected clients; learn the theory behind ARP poisoning and MITM attacks.</LI>
<LI>Change the flow of packets in a network; launch man-in-the-middle attacks; gain access to an account accessed by any client in your network. </LI>
<LI>Capture all passwords entered by clients on the same network; bypass HTTPS/SSLRedirect DNS requests (DNS Spoofing); </LI>
<LI>Capture and inject cookies (to gain access to accounts without a password); create fake Login Pages and redirect real pages to the fake one</LI>
<LI>Sniff packets from clients and analyse them to extract important info such as passwords, cookies, URLs, videos, images, and so on; </LI>
<LI>Detect ARP poisoning and protect yourself and your network against it, and combine individual attacks to launch even more powerful attacks.</LI>
